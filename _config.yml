summary: I'm Bruno, a 34 year-old Engineer and IB Mathematics teacher. I believe that, when teaching, one should meet students where they are, while incentivizing productive struggle (using open ended questions and projects is valuable here) in order to develop communication, inquirer capabilities and problem solving skills. Encouraging students to take risks and learn from their mistakes will make them lifelong learners.
